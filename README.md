The hand-tracking virtual keyboard is an innovative, contactless typing system that allows users to input text using only their hands and finger movements, without the need for a physical keyboard. By leveraging computer vision and hand-tracking technology, the system detects and interprets finger positions, gestures, and movements in real time, mapping them to corresponding keys on a virtual interface displayed on the screen. This eliminates the need for hardware, making it highly portable, hygienic, and accessible. Such a keyboard can be used in AR/VR environments, assistive technologies, public kiosks, and futuristic human-computer interaction systems, providing a seamless typing experience that feels natural and intuitive while also reducing dependency on traditional input devices.
